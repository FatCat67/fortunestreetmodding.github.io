changelog:
  - version: 2022.09.16
    added:
      - Two "Roll 1/3/5 to warp to a take-a-break square. Roll 2/4/6 to warp to the arcade." squares, one on each possible loop. This venture card was considered when initially placing the Arcade and Take-a-break squares in the original 2017 design of Cat Map, and with new advanced technology, we can make this venture card a real mechanic of the board, forcing players to leave their comfortable loops, if they are unfortunate enough to warp to their non-preferred side.
      - All shops now cater to cats. (Shops named)
      - Cat music and sound effects. Not all are replaced at the moment. Fortune Street's sound design is hard to beat.
      - Cat 3D Background. They are waiting for Yoshi to hatch.
      - Cat icon with picture of my Seal Point Himalayan cat, "Baby". (Technically this was added 2022.08.28)
    changed:
      - Cat Map is now 2 squares wider. The result is cute.
      - Entire map re-created from blank slate in order to make shop IDs more consecutive. This will reduce camera flinging during venture cards that affect multiple properties.
      - Blue and Lilac distracts have been buffed with one additional shop each, but shop values nerfed to compensate.
      - Pink District has been consolidated into the Mouth in order to make it wider, shop values nerfed to compensate.
      - Vacant plots have been replaced 1 shop on each ear for a total of 4 total vacant plots on the board.
      - Shop values on the ears have been nerfed.
      - Arcade square moved from cat's right ear to middle of map.
      - Cannon removed, replaced with extra Roll On square, towards the middle.
      - Extra Clover at top of map and Extra Spade at bottom of map, in order to balance direction choice when warping to Arcade/Take-a-break.
      - Boom squares on both top and bottom half of board. The bottom Boom square replaces a Venture square that existed before.
      - Venture Card table has been entirely re-evaluated. Full changelog is available in git history, but most notably, Cameo Adventures have been enabled and Arcade Ventures have been disabled. Cameos are fun, and Slurpodrome must not be prevented by inferior minigames.
      - Starting Cash has been raised from 2240 to 2400, since there are now more shops on the map and 2240 was a strange number. It originally was unintentionally inherited from the base game board overwritten.
    removed:
      - Crashing bug can no longer be triggered. Previously if someone chose to pass through both whisker doors in the same roll (rolling 8 from one of the exposed cyan shops), then say NO I DO NOT WISH TO STOP, the game would crash. It is no longer possible to travel the entire mouth to pass through 2 doors, since the design of the mouth is now 9 tiles long.
  - version: 2021.02.05
    added:
      - Venture card table
    removed: 
      - Removed BOON SQUARE ISLAND again, since it is now possible to set which venture cards are active.
  - version: 2020.10.08
    added: 
      - Added BOON SQUARE ISLAND at the request of Deflaktor. Although venture card 125 is a very rare card to pick, it is unfortunately necessary to include a boon square somewhere on the map. Cat Map was already purrfect so I did not include a very lame and uninteresting boon square on the original design of Cat Map. (although if I were to do so, the obvious tile choice is the Venture square on the bottom left).
    changed: 
      - "The addition of BOON SQUARE ISLAND changes gameplay in this way: 1) The cat now has a ball to play with. 2) in the late game, players may choose to warp here on purpose to temporarily escape high priced shops."
  - version: 2017.05.31
    added: 
      - 2017 is the last time I worked on this. It may still benefit from some balancing changes, but overall a great map that has been thoroughly tested with friends. :-)
  - version: 2015.10.20
    added:
      - Board was first in development. Available for download at http://www.mediafire.com/download/oxkfk08fpnpp7u4/cat.frb but it crashes. Ozzy Mandice suggested removing the one-way doors on the bottom whiskers to get it to work. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_UwD8d_ow
